#### For this project, I will use Bash scripting, PostgreSQL, and Git to create a number guessing game that runs in the terminal and saves user information. </br>
The sql dump file at [number_guess.sql](https://github.com/Cappu123/freeCodeCamp_Relational_Databases_Course/blob/main/Build%20a%20Number%20Guessing%20Game/number_guess.sql)</br> and
The shell script to run the program at [number_guess.sh]() </br></br>

You can find the instruction at the [instruction.md] file.
